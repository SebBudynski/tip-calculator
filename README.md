## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS preprocesor



### What I learned

This project was a real game-changer for me! I got to dive deeper into some cool advanced JS stuff and seriously level up my SCSS skills. Getting started with node-sass was a bit of a workout, but totally worth it in the end.

### Continued development

For my next project, I'm planning to polish up the skills I've already picked up. It's all about getting better, one step at a time!
